## FieldX apps

These apps are for specific use-cases. It is developed to cater special visualization needs for soil data. The apps are developed with the aid of Gemini (an AI agent from Google). 

General instructions and desired outputs from which each app was design was purely from its author and some colleagues. 

The AI agent was used to help in generating and providing options for best implementation and script structure. 

Many of the developed apps here are also based on research studies and articles where the author was inspired to design an app for simplicity in use and output generation.

Several apps are still on the pipeline and some apps are always updated for new feature/s or for code robustness.
